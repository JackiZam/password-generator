# password-generator
The goal of this project is to use Python to create a password generator. The program will take two inputs from the user: the first input will be any words or phrases that the user would like to potentially have in their passwords, and the second input will be any numbers that the user would like in their password. The program will take these inputs, and output a password consisting of a random word from the list that the user provided, and a random combination of numbers. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency with the Python language.
